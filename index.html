            <h1 id="pageTitle">Music: A Universal Language</h1>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I have always believed that music can help a express the inner emotion of a person's soul; the truest person that they are inside and out. I think music is the language that it speaks and how the soul can destress itself. So here are some of my own favorites of music. Perhaps you might learn more about me just by knowing these bands and songs that I relate so deeply with. Enjoy the read!</p>

                  </ul>
                  <p>This is and will always be the overarching favorite. I own all of the albums, discover new inspirations for their songs and learn all kinds of weird trivia lessons about them all the time. Look deep into each member of the band and you will find musical genius in everything they do. For example, the drums on "When the Levee Breaks," have a deep, echo in them because they were recorded with the drums positioned at the bottom of the staircase. The sound traveled throughout the space and created an amazing atmosphere for the song to build on.</p>

                  <p>Another amazing band whose psychedelic sounds led me to explore and enjoy many of the newer artists that will be discussed below. Pink Floyd is a very important band to me because of the genius in many of the lyrics that were written. Their songs are layered with meaning, and the bending of the guitar from David Gilmour will forever be an inspiration for my own guitar playing.</p>

                     <p>Jim Morrison passed away far too young. From the lyrics and stories that I have read about the man, he seems to be just a fascinating individual, which seems to speak through the lyrics he wrote and his vocals in the songs of The Doors. </p>

                     <p>The band Goose, has been a brand new discovery for me. I heard them at Bonnaroo, a music festival just south of Nashville, TN, and they have become a very strong favorite of mind. They are a jam band that just seems to enjoy the artistry of playing music. The songs during their concerts regularly fell into 10 minute sections of the band just playing their instruments and jamming together with their audience. Such beautiful work from these guys.</p>

                     <p>The Arctic Monkeys have been such a wonderful, albeit late, discovery for me in the last few years. I discovered them through listening to a few of my regular music stations on my phone, and I have explored their music much more deeply and have found such a wonderful, riff-heavy group with unusual phrasing of their lyrics. I will be seeing them in concert in the near future and could not be more excited to get out for them.</p>

                     <p>Another late discovery for me (I just started listening to their music regularly in the last 2 years), I can see why The Black Keys have become so popular. They seem to pull some inspiration from different classic rock artists than many modern artists do. Some people may say that rock is dead, but many artists are definitely finding success through this music. The Black Keys are one of those artists. What's even more impressive to me is the fact that the band has only two members. They are a big inspiration for me in the modern music world.</p>
